# TED-TALKS
Conducted an analysis of over 2,500 TED Talks, focusing on view counts, audience engagement, and trends. Cleaned and transformed data, visualized findings using Python libraries, and examined the correlation between comments and views. This project enhanced my analytical skills and provided insights into public engagement with influential ideas.
